# boom-blox-challenge

Welcome to the boom blox code challenge.
I have developed the following application in accordance with the established requirements.

Instructions (PC + mouse/keyboard)

- Right mouse : orbit around scene
- Left mouse click : fire (keep pressed to charge shot)
- Mouse wheel : zoom in/out
- Esc key : reset blocks and points

Instructions (PC + Oculus Quest 2 via link cable / Oculus Quest 2 via APK)
- Right Controller / Thumbstick :  orbit around scene
- Right Controller / Grab button + Thumbstick: zoom in/out 
- Right Controller / Trigger: fire (keep pressed to charge shot)
- Right Controller / B button: reset blocks and points

Notes:
1. To ensure Oculus quest is properly recognised via link cable, be sure to first connect the quest and launch the link.
	Once in the Rift home, launch the attached exe.
2. If the attached exe is launched withouth a Quest connected, it will automatically switch to mouse/keyboard controls.
3. Installed APK on the Quest 2 will be found under Unknown Sources in the app menu.
4. In vr mode, be sure to properly press the grab button before zooming with the thumbstick, otherwise you will orbit instead.
	Zoom and Orbit are mutually exclusive.
